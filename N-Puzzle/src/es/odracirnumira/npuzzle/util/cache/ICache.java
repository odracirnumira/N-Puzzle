/**
 * Interface for a cache that associates keys to objects, so objects are retrievable by key. This
 * class works like a map. However, one cannot expect objects to keep alive forever if they are put
 * into the cache. This means that an object that is inserted into the cache may be removed from the
 * cache at any moment.
 * <p>
 * The exact algorithm used to handle removing objects from the cache is defined by subclasses, so
 * one cannot assume anything about when an object will disappear from the cache.

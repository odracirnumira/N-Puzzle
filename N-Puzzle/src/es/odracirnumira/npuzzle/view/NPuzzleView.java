/**
 * A {@code View} that can be used to show an {@link NPuzzle} and interact with it. This view is
 * connected to the underlying {@code NPuzzle} as an observer.
 * <p>
 * When the puzzle is modified, the view is modified to display the new puzzle, by showing an
 * animation that moves the tile to the empty position. To control that the puzzle is not modified
 * until the animation ends, you can use the {@link INPuzzleViewListener} interface to register a
 * listener that is notified when the animation starts and ends (this restriction can be violated,
 * but in that case the current animation will be abruptly terminated).
 * <p>
 * The view can also be used to modify the underlying {@code NPuzzle}. When a tile is moved in the
 * view, the {@code NPuzzle} is modified so it reflects the change that has been made.
 * <p>
 * This class can be drawn even if no puzzle or image is set. However, in that case, an empty view
 * will be displayed.
 * <p>
 * To set an image, use the {@link #setImage(Bitmap)} method. You can use
 * {@link #createDefaultImage(int)} to create a default image for the puzzle, which shows numbered
 * tiles.
 * <p>
 * This is an styleable class. See the <i>NPuzzleView</i> styleable resource for more information.
